Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Add Windows Desktop Build to Staging Deployment

## Context

The `deploy-staging.yml` workflow builds macOS desktop binaries (`build-desktop`, line 116) but has no Windows equivalent. Staging releases only include macOS `.dmg` — no `.msi`/`.exe` for Windows testers. CI artifacts can't be reused because staging builds bake in staging-specific env vars (`VITE_API_URL`, `VITE_ENVIRONMENT=staging`, etc.) that CI builds don't have.

## Changes

### File: `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`

**1. Add `build-desktop-windows` job** after existing `build-desktop` (line 159), modeled on:
- Existing macOS `build-desktop` job (staging env vars, tauri-action release settings)
- CI's Windows jobs (WinFsp install + MSI resource copy)

Steps:
- `actions/checkout@v4` with staging tag ref
- Install WinFsp via PowerShell (same hash-verified download as CI)
- `rustup default stable`
- Cargo cache (`actions/cache@v4`)
- `pnpm/action-setup@v4` + `actions/setup-node@v4`
- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
- `pnpm --filter @cipherbox/crypto build`
- `tauri-apps/tauri-action@v0` with:
  - Same staging env vars as macOS job (`VITE_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `VITE_API_URL`, `VITE_ENVIRONMENT`, `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`)
  - `args: -- --no-default-features --features winfsp`
  - Same release settings (`tagName`, `releaseName`, `prerelease: true`)
  - `tauri-action` handles appending artifacts to an existing release

**2. Update macOS job's `releaseBody`** to mention both platforms.

**3. No changes to `deploy-vps`** — it only depends on server-side builds. Desktop builds run independently in parallel.

## Verification

Push a staging tag to trigger the workflow and confirm both platform jobs run and upload artifacts to the same GitHub release.


If you need specific details from before exiting plan mode (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/michael/.REDACTED.jsonl

> AGENT

The file looks correct. The structure is:

1. **`build-desktop`** (macOS, line 116) — updated `releaseBody` to mention both platforms
2. **`build-desktop-windows`** (Windows, line 161) — new job with:
   - WinFsp hash-verified install + MSI bundled into resources for the installer
   - Cargo cache
   - Same staging env vars as macOS
   - Same release settings (`tagName`, `releaseName`, `prerelease: true`)
   - `args: -- --no-default-features --features winfsp` for the WinFsp feature flag
3. **`deploy-vps`** (line 229) — unchanged, still only depends on server-side builds

Both desktop jobs run independently in parallel (no `needs:` dependency), and `tauri-action` handles creating or appending artifacts to the same GitHub release.

# CipherBox

**Progress:** [████████████████████░░░░░] 134 plans complete across 27 phases (M1 shipped, M2 in progress)

## Recent Work
- **Phase 15, Plans 1-4**: Link sharing complete — invite entity, ephemeral key bridge crypto, tabbed ShareDialog + InvitePage, E2E tests
- **Phase 11, Plans 1-3**: Windows Desktop complete — platform abstraction, WinFsp callbacks, NSIS installer + CI

## Current Position
Phase **15** of 17 (M2): Link Sharing — **COMPLETE** (4/4 plans, 4/4 summaries)
Next sequential phase: **15.1 (Client-Side Search)** — not started, no directory yet

## Key Decisions Made
- ECIES re-wrapping for sharing (not proxy re-encryption)
- Read-only sharing only (no multi-writer IPNS) — deferred to v3
- Ephemeral key bridge pattern for invite links (key in URL fragment only)
- minisearch + idb for client-side search (~8KB, zero server interaction)

## Blockers/Concerns
- Web3Auth custom JWT verifier requires Growth Plan for production (free on devnet)
- CipherBox as identity SPOF — mitigated by key export + IPFS device registry

## Pending Todos
- 11 pending — `/gsd:check-todos` to review

## Active Debug Sessions
- 2 active — `/gsd:debug` to continue

<objective>
Extract implementation decisions that downstream agents need — researcher and planner will use CONTEXT.md to know what to investigate and what choices are locked.

**How it works:**

1. Analyze the phase to identify gray areas (UI, UX, behavior, etc.)
2. **For UI phases:** Generate design mockups via Pencil MCP to visualize options
3. Present gray areas — user selects which to discuss
4. Deep-dive each selected area until satisfied
5. Create CONTEXT.md with decisions that guide research and planning

**Output:** `{phase}-CONTEXT.md` — decisions clear enough that downstream agents can act without asking the user again

**For UI phases, also outputs:** Design mockups in Pencil file (in "Draft: Phase X" frame)

Phase number: 15.1 (required)

**Load project state:**

</context>

<process>
1. Validate phase number (error if missing or not in roadmap)
2. **Create phase branch** — Create `feat/phase-{number}-{slug}` branch for all phase work
3. Check if CONTEXT.md exists (offer update/view/skip if yes)
4. **Analyze phase** — Identify domain and generate phase-specific gray areas
5. **Detect UI phase** — If phase involves UI, prepare for design mockup generation
6. **Present gray areas** — Multi-select: which to discuss? (NO skip option)
7. **Deep-dive each area** — 4 questions per area, then offer more/next
8. **For UI phases: Generate design mockups** — Create visual options in Pencil for user to choose
9. **Write CONTEXT.md** — Sections match areas discussed, include approved designs
10. Offer next steps (research or plan)

**CRITICAL: Scope guardrail**

- Phase boundary from ROADMAP.md is FIXED
- Discussion clarifies HOW to implement, not WHETHER to add more
- If user suggests new capabilities: "That's its own phase. I'll note it for later."
- Capture deferred ideas — don't lose them, don't act on them

**Domain-aware gray areas:**
Gray areas depend on what's being built. Analyze the phase goal:

- Something users SEE → layout, density, interactions, states
- Something users CALL → responses, errors, auth, versioning
- Something users RUN → output format, flags, modes, error handling
- Something users READ → structure, tone, depth, flow
- Something being ORGANIZED → criteria, grouping, naming, exceptions

Generate 3-4 **phase-specific** gray areas, not generic categories.

**UI Phase Detection:**
Check if phase involves UI work:

- Phase name contains: "UI", "restyle", "design", "layout", "component", "page", "view"
- Phase goal mentions: visual, styling, interface, appearance, frontend, display
- Phase involves: user-facing changes, screens, forms, dialogs

If UI phase detected, enable Pencil MCP design ideation workflow.

**Probing depth:**

- Ask 4 questions per area before checking
- "More questions about [area], or move to next?"
- If more → ask 4 more, check again
- After all areas → "Ready to create context?"
- **For UI phases:** "Would you like me to generate design mockups based on our discussion?"

**Do NOT ask about (Claude handles these):**

- Technical implementation
- Architecture choices
- Performance concerns
- Scope expansion
  </process>

<success_criteria>

- Gray areas identified through intelligent analysis
- User chose which areas to discuss
- Each selected area explored until satisfied
- Scope creep redirected to deferred ideas
- CONTEXT.md captures decisions, not vague vision
- User knows next steps
  </success_criteria>

Created: `.planning/phases/15.1-client-side-search/15.1-CONTEXT.md`

## Decisions Captured

### Search Interface
- Command palette overlay (Cmd/Ctrl+K + clickable icon)
- Escape and click-outside dismiss

### Result Presentation
- File type icons (lucide), name + path + date, keyboard navigable
- Navigate to parent folder on select

### Index Scope & Behavior
- Files and folders, fuzzy matching, auto-update on IPNS poll
- Encrypted in IndexedDB

### Empty & Edge States
- Simple "No results" message, build-on-first-open

### Approved Design
- Option B: Spacious (600px, file type icons) — frame `rLDDc` in Pencil

## Noted for Later
- Recent search history — future release
- Shared item search — separate phase

<objective>
Create executable phase prompts (PLAN.md files) for a roadmap phase with integrated research and verification.

**Default flow:** Research (if needed) → Plan → Verify → Done

**Orchestrator role:** Parse arguments, validate phase, research domain (unless skipped or exists), spawn gsd-planner agent, verify plans with gsd-plan-checker, iterate until plans pass or max iterations reached, present results.

**Why subagents:** Research and planning burn context fast. Verification uses fresh context. User sees the flow between agents in main context.
</objective>

<context>
Phase number: 15.1 (optional - auto-detects next unplanned phase if not provided)

**Flags:**
- `--research` — Force re-research even if RESEARCH.md exists
- `--skip-research` — Skip research entirely, go straight to planning
- `--gaps` — Gap closure mode (reads VERIFICATION.md, skips research)
- `--skip-verify` — Skip planner → checker verification loop

Normalize phase input in step 2 before any directory lookups.
</context>

<process>

## 1. Validate Environment

```bash
ls .planning/ 2>/dev/null
```

**If not found:** Error - user should run `/gsd:new-project` first.

## 2. Parse and Normalize Arguments

Extract from 15.1:

- Phase number (integer or decimal like `2.1`)
- `--research` flag to force re-research
- `--skip-research` flag to skip research
- `--gaps` flag for gap closure mode
- `--skip-verify` flag to bypass verification loop

**If no phase number:** Detect next unplanned phase from roadmap.

**Normalize phase to zero-padded format:**

```bash
# Normalize phase number (8 → 08, but preserve decimals like 2.1 → 02.1)
if [[ "$PHASE" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
  PHASE=$(printf "%02d" "$PHASE")
elif [[ "$PHASE" =~ ^([0-9]+)\.([0-9]+)$ ]]; then
  PHASE=$(printf "%02d.%s" "${BASH_REMATCH[1]}" "${BASH_REMATCH[2]}")
fi
```

**Check for existing research and plans:**

```bash
ls .planning/phases/${PHASE}-*/*-RESEARCH.md 2>/dev/null
ls .planning/phases/${PHASE}-*/*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null
```

## 3. Validate Phase

```bash
grep -A5 "Phase ${PHASE}:" .planning/ROADMAP.md 2>/dev/null
```

**If not found:** Error with available phases. **If found:** Extract phase number, name, description.

## 4. Ensure Phase Directory Exists

```bash
# PHASE is already normalized (08, 02.1, etc.) from step 2
PHASE_DIR=$(ls -d .planning/phases/${PHASE}-* 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [ -z "$PHASE_DIR" ]; then
  # Create phase directory from roadmap name
  PHASE_NAME=$(grep "Phase ${PHASE}:" .planning/ROADMAP.md | sed 's/.*Phase [0-9]*: //' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' ' '-')
  mkdir -p ".planning/phases/${PHASE}-${PHASE_NAME}"
  PHASE_DIR=".planning/phases/${PHASE}-${PHASE_NAME}"
fi
```

## 5. Handle Research

**If `--gaps` flag:** Skip research (gap closure uses VERIFICATION.md instead).

**If `--skip-research` flag:** Skip to step 6.

**Otherwise:**

Check for existing research:

```bash
ls "${PHASE_DIR}"/*-RESEARCH.md 2>/dev/null
```

**If RESEARCH.md exists AND `--research` flag NOT set:**
- Display: `Using existing research: ${PHASE_DIR}/${PHASE}-RESEARCH.md`
- Skip to step 6

**If RESEARCH.md missing OR `--research` flag set:**

Display stage banner:
```

### Spawn gsd-phase-researcher

Gather context for research prompt:

```bash
# Get phase description from roadmap
PHASE_DESC=$(grep -A3 "Phase ${PHASE}:" .planning/ROADMAP.md)

# Get requirements if they exist
REQUIREMENTS=$(cat .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md 2>/dev/null | grep -A100 "## Requirements" | head -50)

</execution_context>

<objective>
Create executable phase prompts (PLAN.md files) for a roadmap phase with integrated research and verification.

**Default flow:** Research (if needed) → Plan → Verify → Done

**Orchestrator role:** Parse arguments, validate phase, research domain (unless skipped or exists), spawn gsd-planner agent, verify plans with gsd-plan-checker, iterate until plans pass or max iterations reached, present results.

**Why subagents:** Research and planning burn context fast. Verification uses fresh context. User sees the flow between agents in main context.
</objective>

<context>
Phase number: 15.1 (optional - auto-detects next unplanned phase if not provided)

**Flags:**
- `--research` — Force re-research even if RESEARCH.md exists
- `--skip-research` — Skip research entirely, go straight to planning
- `--gaps` — Gap closure mode (reads VERIFICATION.md, skips research)
- `--skip-verify` — Skip planner → checker verification loop

Normalize phase input in step 2 before any directory lookups.
</context>

<process>

## 1. Validate Environment

```bash
ls .planning/ 2>/dev/null
```

**If not found:** Error - user should run `/gsd:new-project` first.

## 2. Parse and Normalize Arguments

Extract from 15.1:

- Phase number (integer or decimal like `2.1`)
- `--research` flag to force re-research
- `--skip-research` flag to skip research
- `--gaps` flag for gap closure mode
- `--skip-verify` flag to bypass verification loop

**If no phase number:** Detect next unplanned phase from roadmap.

**Normalize phase to zero-padded format:**

```bash
# Normalize phase number (8 → 08, but preserve decimals like 2.1 → 02.1)
if [[ "$PHASE" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
  PHASE=$(printf "%02d" "$PHASE")
elif [[ "$PHASE" =~ ^([0-9]+)\.([0-9]+)$ ]]; then
  PHASE=$(printf "%02d.%s" "${BASH_REMATCH[1]}" "${BASH_REMATCH[2]}")
fi
```

**Check for existing research and plans:**

```bash
ls .planning/phases/${PHASE}-*/*-RESEARCH.md 2>/dev/null
ls .planning/phases/${PHASE}-*/*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null
```

## 3. Validate Phase

```bash
grep -A5 "Phase ${PHASE}:" .planning/ROADMAP.md 2>/dev/null
```

**If not found:** Error with available phases. **If found:** Extract phase number, name, description.

## 4. Ensure Phase Directory Exists

```bash
# PHASE is already normalized (08, 02.1, etc.) from step 2
PHASE_DIR=$(ls -d .planning/phases/${PHASE}-* 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [ -z "$PHASE_DIR" ]; then
  # Create phase directory from roadmap name
  PHASE_NAME=$(grep "Phase ${PHASE}:" .planning/ROADMAP.md | sed 's/.*Phase [0-9]*: //' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' ' '-')
  mkdir -p ".planning/phases/${PHASE}-${PHASE_NAME}"
  PHASE_DIR=".planning/phases/${PHASE}-${PHASE_NAME}"
fi
```

## 5. Handle Research

**If `--gaps` flag:** Skip research (gap closure uses VERIFICATION.md instead).

**If `--skip-research` flag:** Skip to step 6.

**Otherwise:**

Check for existing research:

```bash
ls "${PHASE_DIR}"/*-RESEARCH.md 2>/dev/null
```

**If RESEARCH.md exists AND `--research` flag NOT set:**
- Display: `Using existing research: ${PHASE_DIR}/${PHASE}-RESEARCH.md`
- Skip to step 6

**If RESEARCH.md missing OR `--research` flag set:**

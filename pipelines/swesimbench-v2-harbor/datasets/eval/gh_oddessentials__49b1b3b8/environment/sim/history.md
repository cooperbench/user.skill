[DEVELOPER]: Carefully review the current state of this project, our dev container, invariants, strict standards, local/ci parity, and enterprise-grade best practices. Once you are familiar with these patterns and best practices let me know you are prepared to proceed.

[AGENT]: I'll review the project thoroughly. Let me start by reading the key files the project instructions point me to, while exploring the overall structure.

[AGENT]: This is a rich spec. Let me read the other key reference files and explore the broader structure in parallel.

[AGENT]: Let me read the contracts, quickstart, and the governance files referenced throughout (constitution, parity invariants), plus get a structural overview.

[AGENT]: Now let me read the governance files (constitution, parity invariants), the quickstart, and explore the actual project structure and devcontainer files in parallel.

[AGENT]: Now the governance files and current actual state. Let me explore the project structure and read the constitution and parity invariants in parallel.

[AGENT]: This is a heavily-governed enterprise repo. Let me read the core governance and current devcontainer state in parallel.

[AGENT]: Let me read the rest of the parity invariants, the constitution, and the actual current devcontainer files.

[AGENT]: Now the constitution and the actual current devcontainer files. Let me read these in parallel.

[AGENT]: Now let me examine the actual current devcontainer implementation, the modified file in git status, and the agents/invariants doc.

[AGENT]: The actual `devcontainer.json` has notably diverged from the spec contracts (entire wiring moved OUT of `postCreateCommand`; `pnpmVersion: "none"` added). Let me read the actual Dockerfile, the modified file in git status, and the tracked verifier.

[AGENT]: The Dockerfile closely matches the spec. Now let me check the current working-tree change, the recent git history around the devcontainer work, and the remaining wiring (`.devcontainer/` contents, `.entire/`, `.husky/`, `agents/`).

[AGENT]: The refactor (spec 364) is merged to `main` via #416, with #417/#418 as post-merge fixes — and #418's removal of `entire` wiring from `postCreateCommand` means the `specs/364` contracts are now partly stale vs. shipped code. Let me confirm the tracked verifier matches shipped state, understand the `.entire` working-tree change, and read the authoritative `agents/` governance docs.

[AGENT]: Let me read the two authoritative `agents/` governance documents to complete my understanding of the strict standards.

[AGENT]: Let me confirm the shipped verifier is self-consistent with the post-#418 `devcontainer.json` (entire removed from `postCreateCommand`) by inspecting and actually running it, and verify the husky wiring.

[AGENT]: Everything is internally consistent: the tracked `verify-contract.py` passes against the shipped `devcontainer.json` (exit 0), and it now *rejects* `entire` wiring in `postCreateCommand` — the inverse of what the `specs/364` Contract 1 still prescribes. Let me check my project memory index before summarizing.

[AGENT]: Memory is empty. I'll record one durable, non-obvious navigational fact for future sessions: the spec-vs-shipped divergence (CLAUDE.md points at a gitignored, now-partly-stale spec as source of truth). The governance docs themselves are well-recorded in the repo, so I won't duplicate those.

[AGENT]: Let me fix a forward-link in that memory (the husky/commit-msg asymmetry is already documented in-repo at parity row 7f, so it shouldn't be a separate memory), then add the index pointer.

[AGENT]: I've completed a thorough review. Here's what I've internalized. ## Project state **ado-git-repo-insights** extracts Azure DevOps Git/PR data → SQLite (source of truth) → deterministic CSVs for a PowerBI model, shipped both as a CLI (`src/`) and an ADO Pipeline Task / VS Code-style extension (`extension/`, VSIX). Release is semantic-release driven (currently `101.28.2`). The active work I focused on is the **dev container refactor (spec 364)**, which is **merged to `main`** via #416 (atomic refactor: `gh`, `specify`, `entire`, Node Feature) and hardened by #417 (ghcr publish fix) and #418 (entire wiring relocation). ## Dev container (current shipped reality) - **Base** `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.12-bookworm`. Node 22 + pnpm are deliberately **not** in the image — Node arrives via the digest-pinned `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/node` Feature (`version:"22"`, `pnpmVersion:"none"`), pnpm via Corepack in `postCreateCommand` (fail-closed against `9.15.0`). It's a "Dev Containers-ready base," **not** a `docker run`-testable image (FR-009). - **Dockerfile** keeps repo-coupled/determinism-sensitive tools pinned: uv 0.11.9, gitleaks 8.18.4 (SHA-verified, QG-56), `gh` 2.93.0 (apt + signed keyring + `apt-mark hold`), Spec Kit 0.9.2 (git-commit pin via `uv tool`), `entire` 0.7.3 (SHA-verified release binary), Playwright 1.60.0 deps (temp-Node install→purge trick to satisfy FR-009). - **Auth model**: two project-scoped named volumes (`…-gh-config` → `~/.config/gh`, `…-entire-config` → `~/.entire`) persisted across rebuilds; `onCreateCommand` […]

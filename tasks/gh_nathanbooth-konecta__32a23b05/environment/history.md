Looking at the "Generate image metadata" step (line 153), the non-prod branch already builds tags including the SHA and a branch-specific prefix. To add a `develop` tag when the source branch is `develop`, I just need to append it to the `TAGS` string in that conditional block.

Done. When the source branch is `develop`, the image will now be pushed with an additional `develop` tag alongside the existing `<sha>`, `dev-<sha>`, and `latest` tags. This is added at [docker-build-push.yml:183-186](.github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml#L183-L186).

Now let me create a branch, commit, and push.

The diff looks correct - both files have the same `develop` tag addition. Let me create a new branch, commit, and push.

> AGENT

Done. Branch `feature/develop-docker-tag` has been pushed with changes to both workflow files:

- [docker-build-push.yml](.github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml#L182-L185) - added `develop` tag
- [docker-build-push-python.yml](.github/workflows/docker-build-push-python.yml#L541-L545) - added `develop` tag

When the source branch is `develop`, images will now be tagged with `<sha>`, `dev-<sha>`, `latest`, and `develop`.

Want me to create a PR for this?
